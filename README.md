# Advanced-Computer-Vision
In this project Python and OpenCV were used to classify the 10 class traffic signs data for the given subset of BelgiumTSC dataset of images. 

# Pipeline Architecture
•	Load the training and test Data

•	Feature Representation of Images

   o	Detect features 
   
   o	Extract descriptors
   
   o	Make Descriptor clusters 
   
   o	Make features’ frequency histograms and get vector representation
   
•	Machine Learning model for classification

   o	Model Training and Validation
   
   o	Algorithm Selection
   
   o	Testing model using Test set
   
•	Quantitative and Qualitative results
